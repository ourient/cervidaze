#### untitled religious poem

the most alive i'll ever feel<br>
is when you cut through my skin<br>
and there yields no flesh<br>
i will never be god’s perfect lamb<br><br>


show me a mirror<br>
and i'll show you the price of decay<br>
angels weep at lives dismembered<br>
but they still see mutilation as sacrifice<br>

</li>
<li><br>
<h4>front windows and open doors</h4>
<p>it's been weeks and days and hours since we last spoke,<br>and all i can do is sweep the
front
doorstep and tidy the kitchen<br>i saved a seat for faith at this dining table, repeating to
myself<br><br>that absence is also a visitor<br>and waiting is also an action</p>
</li><br>
<li>
<h4>451</h4>
<p>death speaks to me in threes and nines<br>
i check the clock as if a minute could tell me anything<br><br>
tell me,<br>
what must the body think after a day's long slumber,<br>
when it sees itself sewn up after being under the knife<br>
i hope i die on an even number<br>
i hope my body thinks it had healed itself overnight<br>
</p>
</li><br>
<li>
<h4>heaven is in the medicine cabinet</h4>
<p>i peel the fibers off each tangerine slice<br>
i don't like the taste of dirt and drought<br>
scrubbing my skin raw in the shower<br>
hoping a new body will no longer repent<br><br>
i watch the water rise to the surface<br>
as the drain struggles to swallow it down<br>
it sputters and cries, engorged with the filth of yesterday's sins<br>
but the purge will prevail, and the waste kept for another day<br><br>

god speaks through sonic soothsaying laughter,<br>
"you will be clean of it soon. you will be clean of it soon."<br>
but there was no blood to rinse off that bathroom faucet,<br>
nor was there a body that could ever be cleansed holy</p>
</li><br>
<li>
<h4>cerritos medical center</h4>
<p>there are medical encyclopedias - erudite chant, never a hymn<br>
never like the way i hear you sigh through the screen<br>
when i tell you i am carrying your sorrow again<br>
i tell the practitioner, "father has thick blood, mother has sick nerves"<br>
and she says, "your heart is not theirs"</p>
</li>
