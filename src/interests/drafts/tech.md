i'm not a tech collector by any means (and think being one would be too costly on my finances and the environment at large), but i do love little gadgets and handhelds as much as the next early 2000s adolescent.

in an effort to balance mindfulness and convenience, i try to use my devices for as long as possible until they become too broken or outdated for daily use. even then, i always buy my tech refurbished or preowned to help stave off the ever increasing supply of otherwise pristine tech discarded only after a couple uses.

i think this habit was passed down to me by my father, who insisted on only buying my things secondhand to preserve his frugal lifestyle, but who's to say?
