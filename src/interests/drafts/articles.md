i studied journalism and film in college, where my cohort tended to mimic the hegemonic tendencies of western state media&mdash;which is to say that they took anything they consumed at face value and didn't bother trying to report critically on marginalized bodies under the guise of &quot;wanting to remain neutral.&quot; this of course was not limited to their craft as storytellers and subsequently extended to their actions as people. my collegiate experience was a bitter one.

some of the pieces here were written for a grade. many of the pieces here were written out of spite.  my positions now, or at least my preferences in articulating them, may not be exactly the same as the ones here. the only use to have come from my degree is the resonance my works had with those who read them then. it's my hope that they will still resonate with a select few now.
