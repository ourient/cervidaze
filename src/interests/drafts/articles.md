i studied journalism and film in college, where my cohort tended to mimic the hegemonic tendencies of western state media&mdash;which is to say that they took anything they consumed at face value and didn't bother trying to report critically on marginalized bodies under the guise of &quot;wanting to remain neutral.&quot; this of course was not limited to their craft as storytellers and subsequently extended to their actions as people.

many of the pieces i published were written out of spite. my positions now, or at least my preferences in articulating them, may not be exactly the same as the ones here, but at the time, they deeply resonated with those who read them. it's my hope that they will still resonate with a select few now. enjoy.
