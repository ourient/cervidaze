<p>they're more like glorified rants.</p>
<p>i studied journalism and film in college, where my cohort tended to mimic the hegemonic and
oppressive tendencies of western state media&mdash;which is to say that they took anything they
consumed at face value because they had no reason to challenge their own societal comforts and
didn't bother trying to report in ways that truthfully and justfully represented marginalized bodies
out of a self-serving interest in &quot;wanting to remain neutral.&quot;</p>
<p>this of course was not limited to their craft as journalists and filmmakers, and subsequently
extended to their actions as people. which meant i was constantly misgendered, ostracized, and shut
down in an environment where expression was said to be encouraged.</p>
<p>this led to me publishing a few manifesto-like pieces out of spite for my alma mater via the outlets
where i was employed. my positions now, or at least my preferences in articulating them, may not be
exactly the same as the ones here, but at the time, they deeply resonated with those who read them.
it's my hope that they will still resonate with a select few now. enjoy.</p>
