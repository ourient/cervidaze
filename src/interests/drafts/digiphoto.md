<h1>digital photography</h1>
<p>when i was 15, i asked my dad for a video camera. he got me a used $400 canon t5i from some guy on craigslist. this fucking thing carried my work well into my 20s.<p>
<p>i later shelled out a good amount of my savings to get a lumix gh5 for my videography gigs, but it's been collecting dust lately. mostly because it costs way more to invest in a proper lens for this body.</p>
