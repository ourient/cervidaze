my main interests are gong fu cha (traditional ceremonial chinese tea) and japanese tea. i'm not particularly interested in western teas, as i've found them to be too heavy-bodied and one-noted for my taste. i tend to go for teas with more vegetal, grassy, roasted, and nutty notes, though i appreciate a delicate floral feel from time to time.

## matcha
### kimikura kagoshima matcha
- medium bodied, moderate umami, walnutty, hint of stringency at the end
- sifts well, thick microfoam if using 4g of it<br>
i like this one quite a lot. no frills everyday matcha. super creamy when paired with oat milk
