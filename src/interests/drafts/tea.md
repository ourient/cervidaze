my main interests are gong fu cha (traditional ceremonial chinese tea) and japanese tea. i'm not particularly interested in western teas, as i've found them to be too heavy-bodied and one-noted for my taste. i tend to go for teas with more vegetal, grassy, roasted, and nutty notes, though i appreciate a delicate floral feel from time to time.
