this DIY site is the revival of our stillness, a blogging project i started several years ago.

my early teenage years were spent exploring what the web had to offer, before it started to only offer monetization. joining the indie web revival is my attempt at rekindling the mortifying creativity and curiosity i once had as a kid with unrestricted access to the internet.

my name is reyn. i'm a 2X year old writer and serial hobbyist based in california. i entered the world as someone entranced by media and i am going to exit the world as someone disgusted by it.

i'm constantly struggling with words, which has manifested itself in many ways; i've written essays, articles, poems, screenplays, and most recently, songs. this site serves as a repository for all of these pursuits (and hopefully more).

i decided to move my creative work to neocities out of spite towards the attention economy. my day job already has me editing shallow, morally bankrupt content on the same five social media platforms for 40 hours a week, so i would prefer if the rest of my life wasn't also wasted on selling my soul to capital.

this is probably the best decision i've ever made for my creative life.
thanks for visiting.
