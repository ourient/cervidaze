	<summary>listening to</summary>
	<p>"if and when i die" by <b>the world is a beautiful place & i am no longer afraid to die</b>. one of my favorite lyrics from it goes as such:</p>
	<p><em>so when my body chooses to become something more, burn it<br>let the liquid in me dry
	up<br>let it crack like the leaves coming through the driveway of the house i grew up
	in<br>divide me among the people i've loved and ask them this:</em></p>
	<p><em>on the day they find a place where the stars are safe from everything but the brightness of the moon, scatter my ashes there<br>so that from which i came<br>can witness that which i've
	become</em></p>

	<summary>working on</summary>
	<p>finding a new job. something that doesn't make me feel like i'm furthering the collapse of
		society</p>
