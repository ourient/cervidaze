<p>I was hoping that life would be a little calmer by now, but my hopes seem to be a bit crushed for the
time being&mdash;my doctor inexplicably denied my Zoloft refill right before I only had a couple
days&rsquo; worth left.<br><br>Maybe the lack of urgency and panic I feel is indicative of some kind of
Buddhist atonement I&apos;ve reached since graduating, but it could also just be that I&apos;ve been too
emotionally steamrolled from the year to perceive stress anymore. At any rate, CVS gave me three pity
pills to hold me over until I get this issue sorted out.<br><br>The man who usually smokes alone with a
bagged Modelo outside my front gate was there when I got home that evening; he gave me a sad glance
before returning to his cigarette. I went inside and grabbed one of my own: an herbal cigarette from a
pack I bought as a prop for a photoshoot. As the smoke rose from my rapidly burning stick, a woman
approached the man with concern. He got up, and the two of them silently entered a black truck. I put my
cigarette out as soon as I watched the car drive off.<br><br>I hope he took some kind of comfort in this
silent form of company.</p>
