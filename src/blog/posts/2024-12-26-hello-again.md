<p>it has been a while since i've updated about anything in regards to my life. it would be insane to try to
list it all out here since a good six months have elapsed since my last post, but i guess i can still
try.</p>
<ul>
<li>migrated my blog to neocities (evidently)</li>
<li>adopted two kittens</li>
<li>started therapy again</li>
<li>started a shoegaze/emo/indietronica band with my friend (per his words, "we wouldn't outright call
ourselves any of that, but it's what we have been compared to")</li>
<li>got preemptively diagnosed with me/cfs aka chronic fatigue syndrome</li>
<li>girlfriend got covid</li>
<li>got promoted at my very corporate job</li>
<li>playing my first show in a couple days</li>
<li>mother's cancer relapsed</li>
<li>started volunteering at a radical bookstore</li>
</ul>
<p>i give up. i&apos;ve been waiting for things to slow down for a while, but i think the thing about my
life is that things rarely ever slow down. it&apos;s a double-edged sword. i hate stagnation and a lack
of change, but i miss the quiet.</p>
<p>i guess most things haven&apos;t changed in that sense. except for the recent possibility of me being
chronically ill. that&apos;s a pretty big change. one that could make it nearly impossible for me to
change anything else from that point forward. poetic justice. or punishment, maybe.</p>
<p>i&apos;m just glad to be still able to make things, this blog included. i think maybe enough wellbutrin
had accumulated in my body to motivate me to learn html and css again. i used squarespace to host my
previous site, which came with an entire slew of problems, the most notable being its
corporate-minimalist branding making it incredibly difficult for me to publish anything without
trying to sanitize it in some self-apologetic manner. i figured moving to somewhere much more lo-fi
would be a more inviting environment to cultivate my creative pursuits.</p>
<p>i guess i was right, because i&apos;ve been inexplicably learning scrappy front-end code for the past
couple of days without worrying about it being bad. i&apos;m actually having fun with it, which is
something my 14-year old self would have never believed. i&apos;m sure i&apos;ll burn out and quit
violently, but i&apos;m just glad i&apos;ve established a decent enough base code to continue posting
here without having to code much more if that were to happen.</p>
<p>if you followed me to yet another platform for my projects, thank you for bearing with me. i&apos;ll be
filling out the rest of this site whenever i find the time. stay deer.</p>
