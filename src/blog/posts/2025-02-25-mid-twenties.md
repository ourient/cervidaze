<p>i had my friend sign my will and advance directive a few weeks ago. it wasn&apos;t for any particular
reason. i just wanted to have them ready in case anything were to suddenly happen and make me unable to
speak for myself.<br><br>i thought the questions in the forms would only be clinical in nature, but i
ended up being asked about things that determine whether i was living a &quot;quality life&quot; or not.
i was asked about what i would want to be surrounded by during my last moments and any final wishes i
wanted to impart on those who would survive me. what i want to spend my life doing and what things would
make life not worth living in their absence.<br><br>i&apos;ve been fixating on how dull my life has been
feeling lately. i spent the past eight years or so trying to work towards a life worth living, and now,
i&apos;m closer than i ever was before. but it feels stagnant. the means i took to get here are as
soul-sucking and normative as any other twentysomething&apos;s. i work a corporate day job using my
background in art and media to completely drain the life out of creative expression for the sake of...
what? brand awareness? KPIs? i live in an apartment owned by people i&apos;ve never met and by people
who likely have never had to work a day in their lives and people who get to raise rent on me by 5%
every year.<br><br>i don&apos;t think i have much else to aim for. besides trying to find a more human
way of living than this.</p><br><hr><br><p>my birthday was about a week ago, and i&apos;m continuing to move into
my mid-twenties. i don&apos;t feel as nauseous as i used to about getting older, but something
definitely still feels unsettling. two of the bands we performed with at our first show broke up, and
i&apos;m anxious that the same is going to happen to us. i feel like we&apos;ve got a really special
thing going, but group dynamics have always been difficult to maintain in adulthood. i&apos;m only
particularly close with three of the members, and one of them is my girlfriend so i don&apos;t even
think that counts.<br><br>we played our second show at this night market over the weekend and we fucked up a
lot, but no one seemed to notice. i hated being there. all the &quot;vendors&quot; were just people who
bought out thrift stores just to resell them at 200% the original price. it was like witnessing a
tiktok-obsessed mall with extra steps. i saw a tank top for $80. i used that money instead to get an
eyebrow piercing from this amazing queer trans asian piercer.<br><br>i found the hinge profile of the
drummer i met at our first show, and surprisingly they matched with me. they were down to meet up and
see where that takes us, but i also feel anxious about that going poorly. i don&apos;t think i
&quot;look&quot; like what most people want to be attracted to in my age group. i don&apos;t exactly
feel like dressing up and posturing like i&apos;m too cool to care about things. i&apos;m tired and
i&apos;m earnest. it&apos;s been a bit since i&apos;ve been in college, and i&apos;m still not used to
having to consciously commit and plan for meeting with strangers. i miss being able to get to know cool
people organically just by being in group environments. but i work from home now, so this is what i have
to do.<br><br>this site has undergone a shit ton of changes since i last made a blog post. i hope
it&apos;s made your experience here a bit more comfortable. my blog posts are probably going to be more
informal as time goes on as i continue to unlearn the over-editing and posturing i&apos;m used to on
&quot;professional&quot; platforms. thank you to all the new folks who have followed me. neocities has
quickly become my new home, and i&apos;m glad to be sharing this space with you all. stay deer.</p>
