<p>The sun is setting at 5 pm now, but I didn&rsquo;t notice until this week because I&rsquo;ve been waking
up at 3 pm these past few days. I optimistically thought that these would be the last few days I sleep
and wake up at god-awful times&mdash;I officially began my 9 to 5 lifestyle yesterday&mdash;but
it&apos;s almost 3 am and I am very awake.<br><br>I am afraid that I don&apos;t actually deserve the job
I have and eventually, my true self will show and everyone will realize how awful of a mistake they made
in hiring a 22-year-old college grad. (That&apos;s the same fucking thing I wrote when I got my first
industry job at 18, word for word.)<br><br>I think because I&rsquo;ve spent the past year or so
unsuccessfully finding full-time work, I&rsquo;m incredibly suspicious that this one seemed to have
fallen into my lap. (Well I&rsquo;m downplaying this; I was interviewing with five people over three
weeks and didn&rsquo;t sleep for the entire time because I was researching every possible way to
maximize my chances of being hired. So this was very much a matter of incredible
effort.)<br><br>It&rsquo;s in a field that I never really thought I&rsquo;d touch&mdash;creative
advertising&mdash;but I&rsquo;m not complaining. I don&apos;t want to complain. Especially since this
job seems kind of ludicrous for something entry-level and post-grad. I think if you&rsquo;re at a point
where a company sends you a Macbook Pro, you&rsquo;re not really in a position to have
complaints.<br><br>I have a job. A girlfriend. An apartment. If it weren&rsquo;t for everything else
happening in my life right now, I think I&rsquo;d be able to breathe for once.<br><br>My mom is on her
second round of chemo, and she has recovered so fast that she has been picking fights with everyone. She
yelled at me for eating take out and made fresh noodles for me when the week before, she could barely
get out of bed without throwing up. I&rsquo;m starting to think that maybe my tenacity was
inherited.<br><br>I&apos;ve been finding myself scrutinizing every passing word or thought I&apos;ve had
lately. I haven&apos;t been able to work on this blog post because I felt like every thought I put on
here sounds too earnest or pretentious. I&apos;ve been worrying about being too earnest online lately.
It&apos;s silly. This is a blog. What am I supposed to do, if not be candid about my thoughts?<br><br>It
feels cool and poetic when other writers brood about their anxiety. But unless I refine my thoughts to
some kind of self-imposed editorial standard, I feel like it would just be pathetic if I did the same. I
don&apos;t know. Did Franz Kafka ever think he was cringe for writing in his diary? I don&apos;t think
he knew millions of people would end up reading it. And relating.<br><br>Maybe he was a little cringe.
