it's been officially one year since i've launched cervidaze. i originally joined the indie web as an escape from social media after the 2024 election—i was pretty vitriolic online and spent most of my time writing numerous rants that responded to (in hindsight, petty) arguments that i was frequently exposed to. it was not a very pleasant online experience.

my website quickly became my new creative outlet, although it did take me a while for me to finally push myself to start. i actually made my neocities account in october, but i didn't roll out the first version of the site until december. i started off knowing barely any html/css. i'm using 11ty and github to run my site now. i'm too far gone.

i've learned that the main obstacle to my hobbies is letting perfection become the enemy of good. because coding was purely for my own benefit and wasn't tied to any of my creative identities, i felt so much more free to create things at my own pace without feeling like i was being held accountable to any sort of quantifiable goals or artistic standards. this has probably been one of my most consistent hobbies in a while.

i've learned so much and found so much joy and community since my time here. thank you all for following the development of cervidaze. i'm glad i'm here.
