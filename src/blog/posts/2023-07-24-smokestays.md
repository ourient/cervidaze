<p>I allow myself one herbal cigarette per month. I don&apos;t even smoke as a habit&mdash;I just wanted to
see if I could do it. I think it takes more discipline to smoke only one cigarette a month than it takes
to smoke none at all. I think the real habit that needs to be cut back is my scrutinizing adherence to
self-imposed tests of will.<br><br>Tonight, I smoked&mdash;an attempt to help ease my nerves before I
sleep. I&apos;ve been experiencing a resurgence of obsessive thoughts about death and misfortune that
has been causing me to only be able to fall asleep around 5 a.m. I typically take half a dose of
melatonin for this purpose, but it caused me to develop vivid dreams about death and misfortune, which I
found to be counterintuitive to its initial purpose.<br><br>My hands have been dryer than usual from all
the hand washing I&apos;ve been doing, and all of the likes on my Instagram posts are even numbers. I
can&apos;t remember the last time I deliberately selected something with odd numbers in
it&mdash;must&apos;ve been at least three or five months ago.</p>
