<small>**note:** as of november 18th 2025, the proceeds i gain from my art will go towards my friend in gaza, ibrahim, and his three children. **we are trying to reach a goal of $250!** ibrahim's circumstances require a faster transaction method than <a href="https://gofund.me/d84cdf94f" target="_blank">his gofundme campaign</a>, so i'll be sending him the funds through paypal. i promise to post a receipt of the transaction to maintain transparency. thank you all, may palestine be free.</small>
