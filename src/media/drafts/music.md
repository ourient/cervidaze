        raw grief. i listened to this album the year my mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, which was either the best time or the worst time to listen to phil elverum reflecting on his wife passing away from pancreatic cancer. he forces you to examine within yourself the human desperation to find meaning in death in order to reckon with its sobering apathy. how making art in memoriam of someone can feel utterly crude when you're grasping against an entity that can't be reasoned with.

        all of TWIABP's music is filled with wounded yearning and a relentlessly hopeful search for a kinder future. this album just happened to have taken ahold of me in a particular way, like my heart is being tugged by some slow gravitational pull. a few of the songs here are a bit different from their usual stuff in the sense that they are spoken and not sung, but they also happen to be my favorites. i'm also just a sucker for narrative devices involving outer space as a metaphor for missed connections.

        bitterness can also be soft and gentle! the mixing in these songs is gorgeous, and temachii's vocals have such an angelic feel. i've yet to grow tired of playing temachii's music over and over again. it's dreamy, resentful, yearning, bleeding, screaming.

        i was born just in time to still be exposed to 2000s indietronica, so thankfully i'm able to bond with my millennial friends over the postal service and death cab for cutie. i really don't know what to say about this. it's pleasant, a little quirky, but not too much. "such great heights" has been used in so many commercials at this point. ben gibbard does what he does best, which is being a really sad hipster white guy in seattle. it was beautiful to hear them live for the album's 20th anniversary.

        i once saw a <a href="https://youtu.be/2LQD4YfiKKU?si=4E2swjK350HwCRgp" target="_blank">video</a> parodying JPEG's music by blasting a shit ton of explosions, gun shots, and discord notification sound effects for 30 seconds straight. the worst part is that JPEG has actually used these samples in at least one of his songs. that being said, i love this album, and i love when artists include electric guitar riffs in rap and hip hop. if you can work with his somewhat chronically online material, you'll be pleasantly rewarded with crazy flow and some pretty sick music production.

        <h3 class="no-margin">transatlanticism by death cab for cutie</h3>
        <br>
        i have tried to learn almost all of the songs from this album on my guitar. death cab for cutie is pretty well-known for its wistful and sometimes overpoetic lyrics, but i find that endearing. it's an album about distance, sparseness, and expanses—which makes sense because the concept of this album is long distance relationships. the way the instrumentals swell creates such a lush soundscape that simply makes you feel like you are part of something grand. this is one of the few albums that i genuinely believe is a beautiful listen from start to finish.
