i have a lot of conflicting feelings about this film. this seems to be a common sentiment.

like objectively, it's a mediocre film. like, the editing had some pretty clever moments and mark's acting was good enough to briefly suspend your idea of "markiplier the youtuber" and immerse yourself into the world of iron lung, but let's not kid ourselves here. there's a lot that could've been improved.

there's clearly no shortage of complaints online regarding the agonizingly slow pacing and muddled audio mixing (which, to my understanding, was because iron lung wasn't meant to be screened in major theaters and was therefore not mastered accordingly). i exited the film feeling like i had ran a mile from how much iron lung kept narratively dragging me through the mud. the sparseness and vagueness of the flashbacks fleshing out simon's backstory felt self-conscious about using cliche methods of exposition—even though the film does that plenty of times without issue several scenes prior. the dead spaces lingering everywhere felt too aimless to be a deliberate curation of atmosphere and suspense. i could keep going, but i don't want to.

there are dozens of better video game adaptations (okay maybe more like two) and hundreds of better indie horror films. we don't exactly need another one for either genre. but making those comparisons to measure iron lung's success, as many mainstream film critics did in some rather harsh reviews, feels a shade or two unfair. maybe it's my existing fondness for markiplier's work or maybe it's my innate contrarian disgust for mainstream media. whatever it is, it just doesn't feel exactly right to talk about iron lung purely in terms of its technical merits. (which to be clear, was not the worst i've seen in films at or above iron lung's caliber! i'd watch iron lung over the minecraft movie any day!)

given iron lung's $3M budget, bare-bones marketing campaign, and most pointedly, the steadfast refusal to work with mainstream hollywood, the film did a damn good job at demonstrating that it's possible to create earnest independent art and find it standing on the same stage as the more conventionally produced projects (which markiplier didn't even aim for in the first place). you can make earnest art.

would millions have watched it if it wasn't created and promoted by markiplier? definitely not. i wouldn't have. it's hard to convince myself to watch anything at all, and i mostly brought up the idea of watching it to my sister as a semi-joke.

i had heard about the drama involving mark's previous projects where youtube and amazon fucked him over egregiously over distribution and creative control. hearing about him successfully directing a film to completion on his own was enough reason for me to go in theaters to watch out of spite for corporate hollywood.

i think iron lung definitely shows promise. i'm not certain where—i would say a future where someone could release a passion project without corporate overhead and still find commercial success, but the thing is that future has already been proven possible by so many beautiful indie projects, and iron lung's box office success was due in part to mark's existing fame and established career as an entertainer. maybe i'm just clinging onto the vestiges of the entertainers i've grown up watching.

i at least know that now, more than ever, where the landscape of filmmaking has never felt so soulless and bleak, we need more projects like iron lung to make it out alive.

        i've largely given up on pursuing filmmaking as a career, but watching these rian johnson films makes me reconsider my stance every once in a while.
