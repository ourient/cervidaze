        <h3 class="no-margin">balatro</h3><br>
        i once opened balatro at 10pm and didn't stop playing until i looked out the window and realized that the sun was rising. i think it's an understatement to say that i enjoyed this game. you don't even need to know anything about poker. you just need to love a good rouge-like, intentionally designed game art, and the dopamine rush from when numbers go up. i have never gambled and never will, but balatro has gotten me pretty fucking close.

        <h3 class="no-margin">disco elysium</h3><br>
        there is nothing that i can say that will add anything new to what has already been praised about disco elysium. it's the best game i've ever read. it's fucking hilarious, it's heartwrenching, it speaks so truthfully about strife and revolutionary hope. it absolutely deserves to be named one of the best games ever made. i do think disco elysium's original concept as a TTRPG shows during its more cumbersome, text-heavy scenes, but consider this an opportunity to retrain your attention span while still playing a video game. it makes all the memes about disco elysium that much more worth it.

        <h3 class="no-margin">sorry we're closed</h3><br>
        this game is so, so lustfully queer. the art director and co-developer of sorry we're closed created this game as a reflection on their desperation to be loved during a state of personal transformation. the playstation 2 inspired graphics and painted character art makes the game so god damn beautiful to play, but the combat system was a bit clumsy and frustrating at times! i love magical realism with biblical tropes, but i couldn't take having to play the entire game all over again just to see the other endings. i still highly recommend playing it, if only to experience how fucking sick the boss battle music is.

        <h3 class="no-margin">yakuza 0</h3><br>
        i have sunk so many hours of my life into this stupid game. the whole yakuza series is utterly ridiculous. with how many substories and minigames RGG has packed into Y0, you will not be running out of things to play anytime soon. i spent literal YEARS wasting time playing mahjong instead of progressing through the main story—which is far from mediocre, by the way. the crime drama storytelling of pre-kiwami kiryu and majima is so god damn tight, but i feel the real gem of the game is how unapologetically unhinged the gameplay is. i love the fishing minigames, i love the karaoke bar, and i fucking love managing the cabaret club. yakuza ruined my fucking life

        <h3 class="no-margin">azul</h3>
        <br>
        my girlfriend called this "chess but prettier." even as a chess hater, i like this board game quite a lot. the art style for the two-player version is absolutely gorgeous. as a strategic tile-laying game, azul's vibe is meant for more methodical board game sessions, though i've still had plenty of funny moments when playing with friends—especially ones that like to be a little petty and competitive. playing azul puts me in the same meditative flow state that playing mahjong does, and the elegance of the tiles makes for a delightfully tactile experience. the game's really obsessed with portugal though.

        <br>
        another tile-laying strategy game, but this time, you're creating habitats for wild animals! the art style for harmonies is so cute, and the game pieces are made out of actual wood! the feeling of completing habitats and maximizing your points through efficient tile-laying is deeply satisfying. it makes for a great casual game to break out for when you have friends over, no matter how experienced.

        <h3 class="no-margin">quacks</h3>
        <br>
        a friend of mine introduced us to quacks, and my girlfriend was instantly hooked—which makes sense since she loves push-your-luck games. learning the rules was fairly easy despite quacks' mild complexity, and we've had much success when playing with both new players and board game novices. quacks and its expansions nicely accommodate a variety of experience levels, and the game design creates the perfect balance of skill and RNG chance. i'm part of the crowd that loves its recent claymation-style redesign, and since we got the deluxe version, the board game pieces are nice to hold and temptingly edible.

        <h3 class="no-margin">wingspan asia</h3>
        <br>
        so my friends and i are currently locked in some sort of wingspan cold war where everyone's waiting on the other to buy it so they don't have to. my girlfriend and i caved and bought both finspan and wingspan asia under the assumption that our friends would eventually get the base game. it's been months, and still, no one has wingspan. finspan and wingspan asia are both fine games. i'd imagine wingspan asia would make the base game even more fun as an expansion, but we wouldn't know what that's like.
