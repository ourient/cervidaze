			<p><small><em>note: this post was originally from our stillness, a now defunct blogging project.</em></small></p>
<p>Our odds have slightly improved. It&apos;s not pancreatic cancer, which is almost always terminal.
It&apos;s ovarian, which is less terminal. She has a tumor the size of a chicken&rsquo;s egg resting in
her abdomen, and that cancer has metastasized into her lungs. Apparently, that doesn&rsquo;t kill
someone as much as a tumor the size of an almond in the pancreas.<br><br>I don&apos;t know if I am
lucky. I don&apos;t want to think of anything that happens to me in terms of luck&mdash;if I did,
I&apos;d convince myself that I&apos;ve been experiencing unceasing misfortune, which would make me feel
more helpless than if I thought I was experiencing life. There&rsquo;s nothing unjust about what&rsquo;s
happening to me. It&rsquo;s just anarchic.<br><br>My mom speaks with an almost defiant sense of
acceptance. &ldquo;No one wants to have a disease,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But once you do, you have to
accept it. And face it. And fight it.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s been putting my hand in a death grip to show me
that she still has her strength. And then, she would let go of my hand to take a small bite of a piece
of chocolate that I&rsquo;d been watching her work on since the week prior.<br><br>I started going to
therapy to begin coping with her loss, but I learned that I was becoming her instead. My therapist
implied that I was exhibiting trauma-born behavior that I likely picked up from my parents.
Psychodynamic therapy.<br><br>I don&rsquo;t want to talk about how she emotionally abused me. I want to
talk about how she&rsquo;s the only person in my family who knows that I am struggling to find work
because she&rsquo;s been the only person in my family who has shown me patience and forgiveness with my
career. I want to talk about how she only speaks English now because no one in the hospital knows
Cantonese. I want to talk about how she wants to cut down the mandarin tree she planted for me when I
was a kid because no one&rsquo;s been eating the mandarins since I moved out and she&rsquo;s too weak to
care for her garden now. I want to talk about how hospital nurses have probably never heard someone beg
so pathetically to keep a tree alive.<br><br>I&rsquo;ve been driving back home sobbing these nights. One
night while struggling to find parking in my neighborhood, I happened upon a man leaving his spot. I
thanked him as he left, and with a raised hand, he said,<br><br>&ldquo;You got lucky.&rdquo;</p>
