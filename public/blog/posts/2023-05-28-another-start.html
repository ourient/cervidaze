			<p><small><em>note: this post was originally from our stillness, a now defunct blogging project.</em></small></p>
<p>OUR STILLNESS was a writing project I began when I was 16 years old in my sophomore year of high school, back when I had too many thoughts to write down and not enough of an audience to read them. I am 22 now, freshly graduated and about to take a hiatus from work and academic projects as I have just graduated from university. I’ve made the decision to continue writing for OUR STILLNESS but am hosting it here instead of its previous home on Weebly.</p>
<p>OUR STILLNESS was, in the loosest of terms, a personal blog I started in 2017 to encourage myself to practice and publish my writing. I began this blog around the onset of my chronic depression and incessantly wrote reflective vignettes, lamentations on perfectionism, and anxious spirals that attempted to sound prose-like. It was a very sad blog with a
very tiny, if not nonexistent, audience. But that blog had dozens of posts and lasted five years. As
unfiltered and melodramatic as it was, OUR STILLNESS laid the foundation for the writer I am
now.</p>
<p>After picking up two media jobs that began to completely block out any free time in my life,
I stopped writing in OUR STILLNESS, instead producing several articles and essays for publications where
I continued to hone my writing. So although it’s been a while since I’ve sat down to write
consciously about my personal life in a nonprofessional context, I’ve never stopped writing. I
don’t plan to stop now.</p>
<p>Welcome back to OUR STILLNESS. I hope you have a nice time.</p>
