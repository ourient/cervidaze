			<p><small><em>note: this post was originally from our stillness, a now defunct blogging project.</em></small></p>
<p>This break is taking a bit longer than I&rsquo;d like. Emails and emails of &ldquo;Unfortunately,
we&rsquo;re moving on with someone else&rdquo; and &ldquo;We hope you continue to keep in touch&rdquo;
have forced me to sit with myself in the uncomfortable and humiliating silence of my one-bedroom
apartment&mdash;one that we&rsquo;ve been trying to get out of since May.<br><br>I&rsquo;ve begun to
manufacture my own growth to compensate for the lack of actual movement in my life. I finally got the
tattoo I&rsquo;ve been waiting for since I was 19, thanks to this surplus of free time giving me nothing
much else to do but draft a design. It&rsquo;s an adaptation of the 1981 animated film Deer of Nine
Colors, stylized in Chinese traditional brush art. I watched this film as a kid with my mother, and its
message still resonates with me now. I like that the deer doesn&rsquo;t get punished for reserving its
kindness in manipulative situations. I like that those who manipulate receive consequences for their
actions. The tattoo is healing well, and so am I.<br><br>This break has given me a lot of time to meet
with my college friends. It was rejuvenating to have had genuine conversations that weren&rsquo;t about
work or school, but I eventually realized how severely deprived I was of such conversations because so
much of my life was blocked out by work and school. I think I am just glad that I still have friends.
Scheduling closeness with others is a skill that I&rsquo;m still developing, though it&rsquo;s been less
mortifying reaching out to people now than it was back then.<br><br>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the
finality of adult friendships a lot&mdash;how on several occasions, I&rsquo;ve outgrown friendships that
I thought would hang on for a little bit longer and how the success of such friendships relies so
heavily on proximity and commitment. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve even properly mourned the
friendships I&rsquo;ve lost since high school. How do I even begin to do that anyway? There&rsquo;s not
really breakup advice for friends. Everyone seems to just let it linger in their chests because
there&rsquo;s no other place to put it. Earnest, meaningful friendships are so scarce now&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t blame anyone for still holding onto the ones that have faded away long ago.<br><br>I feel
like everything I do is a desperate plea for intimacy. Every photo, message, haircut, purchase.
&ldquo;Please see that I exist. Please celebrate with me the fact that I am alive.&rdquo;</p>
