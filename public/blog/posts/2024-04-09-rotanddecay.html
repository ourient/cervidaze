			<p><small><em>note: this post was originally from our stillness, a now defunct blogging project.</em></small></p>
<p>Something I&apos;ve been thinking about recently is how my dad has always been recording home videos of
my sister and I. Even now, though the mediums have definitely changed.<br><br>I remember an old
camcorder hanging from an aluminum shelf in my mom&apos;s then-office. It was dusty and out of
commission, and by the time I was lucid enough to notice it, my dad had already moved onto a slightly
more updated digital point-and-shoot. I had one of my own at the time, but I dropped it in a pool of
seawater, and the memory was promptly destroyed.<br><br>My dad uses his smartphone to record us now,
posting the videos unlinked on an anonymous YouTube channel. I&apos;m not in those videos as much
anymore, as I&rsquo;ve become distant and busy and less inclined to dance in front of the camera. I
guess I have the same modernity to thank for that.<br><br>I&apos;ve been feeling the passage of time a
lot more lately. So many more search queries about medical issues I didn&apos;t know existed. So many
more doctor visits. I&rsquo;m severely allergic to seven different kinds of grass, and my liver is
incapable of handling stress.<br><br>I miss the body and mind I had when I was 19. I&apos;m not much
older, but everything felt snappier back then. More responsive. I hooked up with someone who recently
had his 20th birthday, and I no longer possessed the desire nor the means to retaliate back and forth
with him in banter. The stuff I say is earnest now. Mediocre now. I don&apos;t want or have the energy
to be interesting. Perhaps I&apos;ve been freed. Or convicted.<br><br>Lots of people from earlier
periods of my life have been reaching back out. I get drinks and takeout with them like how we used to
when we first got our driver&apos;s licenses. I&apos;m not the same, but nothing has changed. I steamed
a whole tilapia for the first time in 13 years and ate it alone at my kitchen table. In a sense, I was
having dinner with my younger self, who also ate alone when they tried making the same dish for the
first time.<br><br>I feel myself bridging in and out of my enmeshed selves within the same body, the
same mind. As the things I&rsquo;ve thought to be certain about myself continue to flake off of me,
I&apos;ve been trying to hold on to whatever convictions and principles are left of my character. I
can&apos;t take weed or alcohol without issue anymore, and today I&apos;m visiting a warehouse to shop
for rugs. Rugs.<br><br>I am most definitely dying.</p>
