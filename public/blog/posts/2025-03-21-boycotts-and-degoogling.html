			<h2>boycotts and degoogling</h2>

			<p>lately, i&apos;ve been making an effort to remove myself from as many google products as possible. i made
	the browser switch from chrome to firefox about two years ago, but it wasn&apos;t until i saw a post by
	<a href="https://ykhong.com/" target="_blank">ykreborn</a> that i decided to start migrating the rest of
	my dependencies.<br><br>i thoroughly stand by the statement &quot;there is no ethical consumption under
	capitalism&quot;&mdash;in the sense that despite there being significant merits in being didactic about
	your purchases with regard to societal impact, you cannot simply &quot;buy your way&quot; to radical
	liberation, as all forms of consumption are exploitative to some degree under capitalist society. in
	other words, yes, you should make an earnest effort in reducing your patronage to monopolized corporate
	empires, but it is a short-term solution to our current circumstances, and you ought to be placing your
	energy into more direct forms of resistance instead.<br><br>back to degoogling. if you plan on getting
	started with something similar, it pays to ask yourself what your motivations are, as the answer will
	determine the strategies you implement. the perfect goal would be to divest from all silicon valley
	bullshit, but deregulated markets and technocrats have made this near impossible for the everyday
	person. that being said, many people have begun to divest from google as much as possible due to big
	tech&apos;s recent lapdogging towards the trump administration. others are doing so to safeguard
	themselves from google&apos;s ultimate role as an unsolicited data collector.<br><br>your reasons will
	determine to what extent and with what replacements you&apos;ll degoogle. mine are because i&apos;m
	paranoid and contrarian.<br><br>i&apos;m mostly concerned with making myself less reliant on centralized
	big tech ecosystems, for both political and privacy-related reasons. my approach to this is cutting out
	as many of their products as possible while making certain exceptions for those with genuinely no
	reasonable alternatives; i&apos;ve managed to replace about 80% of my usual google products so far,
	which i think is decent.<br><br>this post shouldn&apos;t be used as a guide for those also wanting to
	divest from google; the subreddit <a href="https://reddit.com/r/degoogle/" target="_blank">r/degoogle</a> was instrumental in streamlining the trial-and-error
	process of finding the best replacements for my personal preferences, and the people there are much more
	scrutinizing and principled than me. i can only offer my impatiently written recommendations that could
	possibly act as a starting point for those with similar goals as me.<br><br>this is what i have so
	far.
</p><br>
<hr><br>
<h4>browser</h4>
<ul>
	<li>i&apos;ve been using <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/" target="_blank">firefox</a> for a while now. even though i hold a healthy amount of skepticism towards their commitment towards privacy, i think firefox is the most accessible option for online laymen who just need to get away from anything chromium. there are quite a few powerful	extensions that have basically eradicated all sense of discomfort i would typically be used to when browsing online. i haven&apos;t seen a <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/" target="_blank">youtube ad</a> in years, and i&apos;m able to <a href="https://shinigami-eyes.github.io/" target="_blank">block TERFs</a> without having to dive into their profiles to perform a litmus test first.</li>
</ul><br>
<h4>email/calendar</h4>
<p>this was
	fairly easy. working with organizers and independent journalists quickly introduced me to <a href="https://proton.me/" target="_blank">proton</a>, a
	free, open-source, and privacy-focused service with a variety of digital products. migration from google
	is a breeze with their dedicated guides, so this was probably the quickest transition i made in this
	process. currently, i use proton for email, file storage, and digital calendars, which all
	work harmoniously with each other and function almost exactly like their google
	counterparts.<br><br>however, proton&apos;s services are still a little lacking, which brings me to my
	next point.</p><br>
<h4>cloud storage</h4>
<p>my only qualm with proton is that they have yet to finish developing
	their document-editing software&mdash;this makes their cloud storage service, proton drive, effectively
	just a file management service that lacks substitutes for sheets, docs, slides, and the like. i still
	use it, just to host my original google drive data so i can cancel my google one subscription. a slight
	plus is that proton drive can sync your devices&apos; files to the cloud, in the same way that onedrive
	or dropbox can. proton drive also offers automatic photo backups in the way that google photos does, but
	(at the time of writing) does not currently offer any way of organizing or cataloging
	photos&mdash;something absolutely necessary for me as a digital artist.<br><br>which is why i use <a href="https://ente.io/" target="_blank">ente</a>
	for my photo cloud storage. it&apos;s a near replica of google photos, except encrypted and open source.
	like proton, they also have a dedicated migration service for those coming from google. they also have a
	feature called &quot;guest mode,&quot; which you can toggle before showing someone a photo so they
	can&apos;t swipe through all the other photos in your gallery. pretty neat.</p><br>
<h4>keyboard</h4>
<p>i had
	some pretty strict criteria for my mobile keyboard, which admittedly made the search for one much
	harder. i wanted one that offered accurate swipe typing, clipboard functions, and no tracking while
	still being customizable. <a href="https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard/" target="_blank">heliboard</a> actually checked those points for me. my only qualm is that
	pinyin/jyutping keyboards aren&apos;t supported, so i currently circumvent that using my native phone&apos;s
	chinese keyboard with online services turned off.</p><br>
<h4>navigation</h4>
<p>this is probably one of the
	hardest. google maps acts as both a navigation service and a reviewing service. i use both. there is
	currently no immediate alternative that can do both. however, out of all the open-source apps that pull data from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank">openstreetmaps</a>, <a href="https://wego.here.com/" target="_blank">herewego</a> has the cleanest UI and most
	accurate routing, so i use that instead.
	for finding reviews and recommendations on where to eat, i use my girlfriend, who uses
	yelp.</p><br>
<h4>misc</h4>
<p>to replace the play store, i use a combination of <a href="https://f-droid.org/" target="_blank">f-droid</a> (where open-source/FLOSS
	devs host their apps) and <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.aurora.store/" target="_blank">aurora store</a> (an app that allows you to download and update apps from the play
	store without a google account). for google wallet, i now use my actual wallet and <a href="https://catima.app/" target="_blank">catima</a> to
	store my membership cards.</p>
