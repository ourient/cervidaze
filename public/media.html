        raw grief. i listened to this album the year my mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, which was either the best time or the worst time to listen to phil elverum reflecting on his wife passing away from pancreatic cancer. he forces you to examine within yourself the human desperation to find meaning in death in order to reckon with its sobering apathy. how making art in memoriam of someone can feel utterly crude when you're grasping against an entity that can't be reasoned with.

        all of TWIABP's music is filled with wounded yearning and a relentlessly hopeful search for a kinder future. this album just happened to have taken ahold of me in a particular way, like my heart is being tugged by some slow gravitational pull. a few of the songs here are a bit different from their usual stuff in the sense that they are spoken and not sung, but they also happen to be my favorites. i'm also just a sucker for narrative devices involving outer space as a metaphor for missed connections.

        bitterness can also be soft and gentle! the mixing in these songs is gorgeous, and temachii's vocals have such an angelic feel. i've yet to grow tired of playing temachii's music over and over again. it's dreamy, resentful, yearning, bleeding, screaming.

        i was born just in time to still be exposed to 2000s indietronica, so thankfully i'm able to bond with my millennial friends over the postal service and death cab for cutie. i really don't know what to say about this. it's pleasant, a little quirky, but not too much. "such great heights" has been used in so many commercials at this point. ben gibbard does what he does best, which is being a really sad hipster white guy in seattle. it was beautiful to hear them live for the album's 20th anniversary.

        i once saw a <a href="https://youtu.be/2LQD4YfiKKU?si=4E2swjK350HwCRgp" target="_blank">video</a> parodying JPEG's music by blasting a shit ton of explosions, gun shots, and discord notification sound effects for 30 seconds straight. the worst part is that JPEG has actually used these samples in at least one of his songs. that being said, i love this album, and i love when artists include electric guitar riffs in rap and hip hop. if you can work with his somewhat chronically online material, you'll be pleasantly rewarded with crazy flow and some pretty sick music production.

        <br>
        i have tried to learn almost all of the songs from this album on my guitar. death cab for cutie is pretty well-known for its wistful and sometimes overpoetic lyrics, but i find that endearing. it's an album about distance, sparseness, and expanses—which makes sense because the concept of this album is long distance relationships. the way the instrumentals swell creates such a lush soundscape that simply makes you feel like you are part of something grand. this is one of the few albums that i genuinely believe is a beautiful listen from start to finish.

        <h3 class="no-margin">iron lung</h3><br>
<div class="scrollbar rounded shorter card-background card-background-light section--padding">
i have a lot of conflicting feelings about this film. this seems to be a common sentiment.
<p>like objectively, it's a mediocre film. the editing had some pretty clever moments and mark's acting was good enough to briefly suspend your idea of &quot;markiplier the youtuber&quot; and immerse yourself into the world of iron lung, but let's not kid ourselves here. there's a lot that could've been improved.</p>
<p>there's clearly no shortage of complaints online regarding the agonizingly slow pacing and muddled audio mixing (which, to my understanding, was because iron lung wasn't meant to be screened in major theaters and was therefore not mastered accordingly). i exited the film feeling like i had ran a mile from how much iron lung kept narratively dragging me through the mud. the sparseness and vagueness of the flashbacks fleshing out simon's backstory felt self-conscious about using cliche methods of exposition—even though the film does that plenty of times without issue several scenes prior. the dead spaces lingering everywhere felt too aimless to be a deliberate curation of atmosphere and suspense. i could keep going, but i don't want to.</p>
<p>there are dozens of better video game adaptations (okay maybe like two) and hundreds of better indie horror films. we don't exactly need another one for either genre. but making those comparisons to measure iron lung's success, as many mainstream film critics did in some rather harsh reviews, feels a shade or two unfair. maybe it's my existing fondness for markiplier's work or maybe it's my innate contrarian disgust for mainstream media. whatever it is, it just doesn't feel exactly right to talk about iron lung purely in terms of its technical merits. (which to be clear, were not the worst i've seen in films at or above iron lung's caliber! i'd watch iron lung over the minecraft movie any day!)</p>
<p>given iron lung's $3M budget, bare-bones marketing campaign, and most pointedly, the steadfast refusal to work with mainstream hollywood, the film did a damn good job at demonstrating that it's possible to create earnest independent art and find it standing on the same stage as the more conventionally produced projects (which markiplier didn't even aim for in the first place).</p>
<p>would millions have watched it if it wasn't created and promoted by markiplier? definitely not. i wouldn't have. it's hard to convince myself to watch anything at all, and i mostly brought up the idea of watching it to my sister as a semi-joke.</p>
<p>i had heard about the drama involving mark's previous projects where youtube and amazon fucked him over egregiously with distribution and creative control. hearing about him successfully directing a film to completion on his own was enough reason for me to go in theaters to watch out of spite for corporate hollywood.</p>
<p>i think iron lung definitely shows promise. i'm not certain where—i would say a future where someone could release a passion project without corporate overhead and still find commercial success, but the thing is that future has already been proven possible by so many beautiful indie projects, and iron lung's box office success was due in part to mark's existing fame and established career as an entertainer. maybe i'm just clinging onto the vestiges of the creators i've grown up watching.</p>
<p>i at least know that now, more than ever, where the landscape of filmmaking has never felt so soulless and bleak, we need more mediocre—but honest—projects like iron lung to make it out alive.</p>

        i once opened balatro at 10pm and didn't stop playing until i looked out the window and realized that the sun was rising. i think it's an understatement to say that i enjoyed this game. you don't even need to know anything about poker. you just need to love a good rouge-like, intentionally designed game art, and the dopamine rush from when numbers go up. i have never gambled and never will, but balatro has gotten me pretty fucking close.

        there is nothing that i can say that will add anything new to what has already been praised about disco elysium. it's the best game i've ever read. it's fucking hilarious, it's heartwrenching, it speaks so truthfully about strife and revolutionary hope. it absolutely deserves to be named one of the best games ever made. i do think disco elysium's original concept as a TTRPG shows during its more cumbersome, text-heavy scenes, but consider this an opportunity to retrain your attention span while still playing a video game. it makes all the memes about disco elysium that much more worth it.

        <h3 class="no-margin">sorry we're closed</h3><br>
        this game is so, so lustfully queer. the art director and co-developer of sorry we're closed created this game as a reflection on their desperation to be loved during a state of personal transformation. the playstation 2 inspired graphics and painted character art makes the game so god damn beautiful to play, but the combat system was a bit clumsy and frustrating at times! i love magical realism with biblical tropes, but i couldn't take having to play the entire game all over again just to see the other endings. i still highly recommend playing it, if only to experience how fucking sick the boss battle music is.

        <h3 class="no-margin">yakuza 0</h3><br>
        i have sunk so many hours of my life into this stupid game. the whole yakuza series is utterly ridiculous. with how many substories and minigames RGG has packed into Y0, you will not be running out of things to play anytime soon. i spent literal YEARS wasting time playing mahjong instead of progressing through the main story—which is far from mediocre, by the way. the crime drama storytelling of pre-kiwami kiryu and majima is so god damn tight, but i feel the real gem of the game is how unapologetically unhinged the gameplay is. i love the fishing minigames, i love the karaoke bar, and i fucking love managing the cabaret club. yakuza ruined my fucking life

        my girlfriend called this "chess but prettier." even as a chess hater, i like this board game quite a lot. the art style for the two-player version is absolutely gorgeous. as a strategic tile-laying game, azul's vibe is meant for more methodical board game sessions, though i've still had plenty of funny moments when playing with friends—especially ones that like to be a little petty and competitive. playing azul puts me in the same meditative flow state that playing mahjong does, and the elegance of the tiles makes for a delightfully tactile experience. the game's really obsessed with portugal though.

        another tile-laying strategy game, but this time, you're creating habitats for wild animals! the art style for harmonies is so cute, and the game pieces are made out of actual wood! the feeling of completing habitats and maximizing your points through efficient tile-laying is deeply satisfying. it makes for a great casual game to break out for when you have friends over, no matter how experienced.

        it took me 5 years (i started this in 2019 at my english teacher's recommendation) to work through the narcoleptic perverseness of what is my first murakami novel—but once the action picked up, i was able to blaze through the remaining 50% in the past week. the first half lulls you with its classic murakami-esque melancholy, then snaps to total mystery without warning. the end will leave you with an existential emptiness that you know won't be resolved. the only thing written in this book that's tethered to any sense of reality is the narrator's crude projected fantasies of unrequited sexual desire that probably take up a third of this book if you put them all together. but also you could take this review and stitch this to any one of murakami's books so if you're looking for anything of substance here im sorry
