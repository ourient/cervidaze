<h1>what i was taught about queerness growing up</h1>
<p><small>A friend of mine decided to hold an interview with me about my experience as a queer
    diasporic Asian —
    it inevitably devolved into me unleashing a pained rant about our community’s collective
    upbringing as
    forced members of the social periphery. Below is the transcript.</small></p>
<p>&quot;I’m not sure it was taught to me because I wasn’t really like sat down and told like, 'Hey
gay people
are gross.' Like that has never like happened to me. But it’s more like offhand comments&mdash;I
think that’s
how it typically goes.</p>
<p>I was taught that queerness inherently makes you vulnerable. I don’t think I was directly taught
that, but it
was something I learned residually from being online and seeing how people were treated. I
learned that being
queer makes you vulnerable, being queer makes you a walking target, it makes you immediately
more huntable. It
makes you stand out more if you don’t hide it. If you don’t hide it, you are a walking target
for many
different kinds of groups.</p>
<p>So I guess I was also taught that queerness was something to hide or to disguise&mdash;because I
didn’t hide
my queerness, but I disguised it and made it palatable. I was taught that queerness had to be
palatable. Which
means watering down so much of yourself to the point where cis people can finally consume it and
not feel
disgusted.</p>
<p>These are really horrible and unhealthy things to be taught about queerness but it’s something I
feel like
all of us kind of were taught. I hate it. I despise it, I feel deep amounts of rage… for
cisheteronormative
society to ever teach someone that they are inherently vulnerable. This is probably why I resent
cishet people
because centuries of indoctrination have led so many people to believe that they are not safe.
And security is
something we desperately need. As humans, we want to feel secure, we want to feel protected and
connected. And
when you have cishet people telling you that you are not safe here, that does things to you,
psychologically.
And so I resent cishet society for doing that to queer people. I would change that so much if I
could, but I
hate that it’s something that we’ve always been taught.</p>
<p>It’s not something that you can flip a switch and say, &apos;Oh suddenly you don’t have to feel
in danger
anymore.&apos; It’s something that you are born knowing. The concept of coming out is something
that I have a
lot of gripes over because culturally, it has a lot of significance. It’s a sacred rite of
passage that a lot
of queer people go through. And it’s something to be expected in queer culture&mdash;when I say
expected, it’s
like when you’re queer, you have to come out in order to be recognized as a member of society
when cishet
people don’t have to do jackshit to already be acknowledged and actualized.</p>
<p>When you are queer, you are denied identification. I think that does a number of things to the
way you
perceive yourself. Because when you’re denied identification, you’re denied security, you’re
denied the
confidence that you exist as a person. I did not think I existed as a person because I felt like
I wasn’t
truly seen as a person who was queer.</p>
<p>I have a lot of gripes with it because queer people shouldn’t have to come out at all. Coming out
is a
mechanization to help queer people assimilate into cishet society. That’s mainly what it is.
Queer people only
have to come out because cishet people made it that way. That’s why I resent it so much. When
you come out,
you perpetuate the idea that queer people are inherently unseen and inherently subordinate to
cishet rule.</p>
<p>And I know it means a lot. I know it means a lot to people because coming out usually means
acceptance&mdash;well not usually, but coming out means the possibility&mdash;it’s not even the
assurance,
it’s the possibility that you are accepted, which is already really awful to think about. You
already don’t
know if you will be accepted, if you’ll be loved, if you’ll be acknowledged as much as a cishet
person.</p>
<p>I think that’s what gets me so much. That queer people have to put themselves through so much
vulnerability
just to receive the bare minimum cishet people are given when they are born. That’s something I
resent deeply.
</p>
<p>Queer people should not have to come out. Queer people should not have to come out. They should
not have to
come out at all. They shouldn’t have to assimilate to cishet society at all&mdash;why do you
want to
assimilate to the oppressor in the first place? That’s not the point. You shouldn’t be taught
that you want
the oppressor’s acceptance.
<p>That’s another thing: you’re taught that you want to gain the acceptance of the oppressor. You’re
taught that
you want cishet people’s love, you are taught that you want cishet people’s acceptance. Fuck if
anyone
cares&mdash;if a cishet person likes who I am or not. Why do I need their acceptance to exist as
a person? Why
do I need a straight person to validate anything about how I feel? Why do I feel like I have to
be seen by a
straight person in order to exist? I resent cishet society for not only rejecting queer people
but making it
feel like in order to stop feeling rejected, they have to play by cishet rule.</p>
<p>I hate the creators of this entire system of assimilation for queer people to jump hurdles and do
all these
things&mdash;you know when trans people want to get gender-affirming surgery, they have to get
legally and
medically confirmed that they are trans in order for a cishet person to determine that they are
trans enough
to get surgery? That’s fucked up. Why should a trans person have to prove anything to a medical
institution
that they want surgery?</p>
<p>Cis people don’t have to fucking do that&mdash;if a cis person wants to get their breasts
removed, they don’t
fucking say shit but when a trans person wants to get their breasts removed, they have to like
they have to go
to therapy, they have to see a psychologist, have to get medical documents authorized and
everything, why?</p>
<p>Why do you need people? Why do you need validation? Why are you taught that you need the
oppressor’s
validation? Why has the oppressor taught us that we need their validation in order to feel
loved?</p>
<p>I have so much rage, so much resentment… so fucking much resentment, for this stupid white cishet
patriarchal
institution that we fucking have to deal with. I hate everything about it. This is abuse. This
is abusive.</p>
<p>It’s an abusive power structure that we have been taught to accept. We’ve been taught to accept
it&mdash;we’ve been taught to do anything but feel like we deserve more. We’ve been taught that
this is what
we deserve… we’ve been taught that we don’t deserve more than this. You’ve been taught that this
is what we
should be happy with and that’s… that’s something that makes me really sad. That a lot of people
are settling
for this very low bar that this fucking place has set for us.</p>
That is my answer.&quot;</p>
