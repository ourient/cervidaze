        <h1>essays</h1>
<p>they're more like glorified rants.</p>
<p>i studied journalism and film in college, where my cohort tended to mimic the hegemonic and
oppressive tendencies of western state media&mdash;which is to say that they took anything they
consumed at face value because they had no reason to challenge their own societal comforts and
didn't bother trying to report in ways that truthfully and justfully represented marginalized bodies
out of a self-serving interest in &quot;wanting to remain neutral.&quot;</p>
<p>this of course was not limited to their craft as journalists and filmmakers, and subsequently
extended to their actions as people. which meant i was constantly misgendered, ostracized, and shut
down in an environment where expression was said to be encouraged.</p>
<p>this led to me publishing a few manifesto-like pieces out of spite for my alma mater via the outlets
where i was employed. my positions now, or at least my preferences in articulating them, may not be
exactly the same as the ones here, but at the time, they deeply resonated with those who read them.
it's my hope that they will still resonate with a select few now. enjoy.</p>

<h4>untitled religious poem</h4>
<p>the most alive i'll ever feel<br>
is when you cut through my skin<br>
and there yields no flesh<br>
i will never be god’s perfect lamb<br><br></p>
<p>show me a mirror<br>
and i'll show you the price of decay<br>
angels weep at lives dismembered<br>
but they still see mutilation as sacrifice<br></p>
</li>
<li><br>
<h4>front windows and open doors</h4>
<p>it's been weeks and days and hours since we last spoke,<br>and all i can do is sweep the
front
doorstep and tidy the kitchen<br>i saved a seat for faith at this dining table, repeating to
myself<br><br>that absence is also a visitor<br>and waiting is also an action</p>
</li><br>
<li>
<h4>451</h4>
<p>death speaks to me in threes and nines<br>
i check the clock as if a minute could tell me anything<br><br>
tell me,<br>
what must the body think after a day's long slumber,<br>
when it sees itself sewn up after being under the knife<br>
i hope i die on an even number<br>
i hope my body thinks it had healed itself overnight<br>
</p>
</li><br>
<li>
<h4>heaven is in the medicine cabinet</h4>
<p>i peel the fibers off each tangerine slice<br>
i don't like the taste of dirt and drought<br>
scrubbing my skin raw in the shower<br>
hoping a new body will no longer repent<br><br>
i watch the water rise to the surface<br>
as the drain struggles to swallow it down<br>
it sputters and cries, engorged with the filth of yesterday's sins<br>
but the purge will prevail, and the waste kept for another day<br><br>
<p>god speaks through sonic soothsaying laughter,<br>
&quot;you will be clean of it soon. you will be clean of it soon.&quot;<br>
but there was no blood to rinse off that bathroom faucet,<br>
nor was there a body that could ever be cleansed holy</p></p>
</li><br>
<li>
<h4>cerritos medical center</h4>
<p>there are medical encyclopedias - erudite chant, never a hymn<br>
never like the way i hear you sigh through the screen<br>
when i tell you i am carrying your sorrow again<br>
i tell the practitioner, "father has thick blood, mother has sick nerves"<br>
and she says, "your heart is not theirs"</p>

<p>when i was 15, i asked my dad for a video camera. he got me a used $400 canon t5i from some guy on craigslist. this fucking thing carried my work well into my 20s.<p>
<p>i later shelled out a good amount of my savings to get a lumix gh5 for my videography gigs, but it's been collecting dust lately. mostly because it costs way more to invest in a proper lens for this body.</p>

<p>i'm not a tech collector by any means (and think being one would be too costly on my finances and the environment at large), but i do love little gadgets and handhelds as much as the next early 2000s adolescent.</p>
<p>in an effort to balance mindfulness and convenience, i try to use my devices for as long as possible until they become too broken or outdated for daily use. even then, i always buy my tech refurbished or preowned to help stave off the ever increasing supply of otherwise pristine tech discarded only after a couple uses.</p>
<p>i think this habit was passed down to me by my father, who insisted on only buying my things secondhand to preserve his frugal lifestyle, but who's to say?</p>

<p>my main interests are gong fu cha (traditional ceremonial chinese tea) and japanese tea. i'm not particularly interested in western teas, as i've found them to be too heavy-bodied and one-noted for my taste. i tend to go for teas with more vegetal, grassy, roasted, and nutty notes, though i appreciate a delicate floral feel from time to time.
